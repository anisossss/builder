Three Models, Single LSTM, double stacked LSTM, and Transfer learning using ResNet were implemented. Different approaches such as K-Fold and LOSO were also experimented on. Our implementation has outperformed the benchmark algorithm. For example, For the drill: the expected results (F1 Score) for some labels were just 5-15% whereas our model gave 21% and above.",
