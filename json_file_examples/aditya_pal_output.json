Developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Langchain, VectorDB (faiss), Streamlit, LLMs on TxB Confluence doc pages on Sagemaker; implemented RLHF. Built an XGBoost ML model to detect anomalies in API requests using certificate name & IP Addresses from Kong API Gateway. Helped set up TxB's training & inference infrastructure (CI/CD, MLOps on Sagemaker) following firm-wide DSML standards. Designed Kafka Cross Region Replication for controlled failover of MSK Cluster to secondary region using VPC Peering & MirrorMaker2 with minimal downtime / message loss. Beta tested AWS MSK team's new replication offering in Q3 2023. TxB's primary Kafka SME responsible for cluster upgrades & resiliency testing. Designed and built a Spring Email Service app using AWS SES with bounce-back / opens / clickstream notifications handling - delivers 500+ emails per day to US & UK clients. Implemented SES Cross domain support saving infra costs & operational risk. Set up blue/green on Web Gateway: added path & host-based ALBs to B/G target routing - achieved Zero Downtime deployments. Implemented Step AutoScaling of Kong API GW based on average requests; Held discussions with AWS for Network Firewall features."
